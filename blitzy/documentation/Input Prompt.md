I need to run simulations -- algorithm originally published in a paper navigating the **Crimaldi plume**. I need to do this in the Crimaldi and a custom plume (the background subtracted avi is the original video). To be comparable, we must account for physical differences between the crimaldi plume and custom plume recording: different arena sizes, different pixel sizes, different recording resolutions (time and space), different intensity units -- and different file formats. The goal should be clear from looking at the batch_run_4000 file. I'm not sure the minimum path to an accurate, operational simulation and analysis of the outcomes. Please provide that for me. I want a clear roadmap and checklist, that differentiates serially dependent development tasks, from independent parallelizable tasks. We don't need to address every bug in the code base so long as we address the bugs that will actually crop up in our simulations. It's critical that the differences between the plume recordings are thoughtfully accounted for. I need to complete this task tonight, so we want a streamlined path towards accurate, reliable simulations. And analysis of results. Thank you!
