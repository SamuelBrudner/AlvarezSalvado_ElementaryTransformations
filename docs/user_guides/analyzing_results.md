## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Analysis Issues

**Analysis Memory Exhaustion**:

*Symptoms*: MemoryError during large-scale analysis, system slowdown, or visualization generation failures

*Common Causes*:
- Insufficient system memory for large result datasets (>10,000 simulations)
- Memory leaks during iterative statistical computations
- Large visualization generation with high-resolution requirements
- Inefficient memory usage in trajectory analysis pipeline

*Solutions and Remediation*:
```bash
# Enable memory-mapped processing for large datasets
plume-simulation analyze \
    --input results/large_batch/ \
    --output results/analysis/ \
    --memory-limit 16 \
    --enable-memory-mapping \
    --batch-size 500 \
    --streaming-analysis

# Alternative: Process in smaller chunks
plume-simulation analyze \
    --input results/batch/ \
    --output results/analysis/ \
    --parallel-workers 4 \
    --chunk-size 1000 \
    --enable-garbage-collection
```

**Statistical Convergence Problems**:

*Symptoms*: Statistical tests fail to converge, inconsistent p-values, or unreliable confidence intervals

*Common Causes*:
- Insufficient sample size for adequate statistical power
- High variance in simulation results affecting convergence
- Inappropriate statistical test selection for data characteristics
- Numerical precision issues in iterative algorithms

*Solutions and Best Practices*:
```bash
# Increase sample size and improve convergence
plume-simulation analyze \
    --input results/batch/ \
    --output results/analysis/ \
    --min-sample-size 1000 \
    --convergence-threshold 1e-8 \
    --robust-statistics \
    --bootstrap-iterations 10000

# Enable variance stabilization
plume-simulation analyze \
    --analysis-type cross_algorithm \
    --variance-stabilization \
    --outlier-detection \
    --alternative-tests nonparametric
```

**Visualization Generation Errors**:

*Symptoms*: Figure generation failures, poor quality output, or format-specific export issues

*Common Causes*:
- Insufficient graphics memory for complex visualizations
- Backend compatibility issues with system configuration
- Large dataset visualization complexity exceeding limits
- Format-specific export restrictions or corruption

*Resolution Strategies*:
```bash
# Optimize visualization settings
plume-simulation analyze \
    --analysis-type visualization \
    --visualization-backend matplotlib \
    --figure-complexity low \
    --export-formats png,pdf \
    --dpi 150 \
    --enable-figure-caching

# Alternative backend configuration
plume-simulation analyze \
    --visualization-backend plotly \
    --interactive-mode \
    --export-static \
    --memory-efficient-rendering
```
