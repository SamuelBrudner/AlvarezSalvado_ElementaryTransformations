# Intensity Dataset Comparison

This page describes how to characterise the intensity of individual odour plumes and how to compare multiple intensity datasets.

## Characterising a Single Plume

To obtain intensity statistics for a single plume, use the `analyze_crimaldi_data.py` script. The command prints summary statistics such as the minimum, maximum and percentile values.

```bash
conda run --prefix ./dev-env python Code/analyze_crimaldi_data.py data/raw/plume1.hdf5
```

Expected output:

```
Min: 0.05
Max: 3.2
Mean: 1.4
Std: 0.8
1th percentile: 0.10
5th percentile: 0.20
95th percentile: 2.9
99th percentile: 3.1
```

## Comparing Multiple Datasets

Use the `compare_intensity_stats.py` script with multiple input files. The script computes crossâ€‘dataset statistics and produces a plot showing the distribution of intensities.

```bash
conda run --prefix ./dev-env python Code/compare_intensity_stats.py data/raw/plume1.hdf5 data/raw/plume2.hdf5
```

Typical output:

```
Plume1 peak: 3.2
Plume2 peak: 2.8
Difference (mean): 0.4

## Notes

- All commands assume the development environment created via `setup_env.sh --dev`.
- Output paths are controlled by `configs/paths.yaml`.
