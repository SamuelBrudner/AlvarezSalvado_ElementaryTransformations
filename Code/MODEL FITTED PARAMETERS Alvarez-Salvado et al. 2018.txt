THESE ARE THE FITTED VALUES USED FOR ALL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL SIMULATIONS DONE FOR THE ARTICLE ALVAREZ-SALVADO ET AL. (2018).


% ON/OFF MODEL PARAMETERS - uses compress-first models
 beta = 0.01;    % Kd for Hill compression
 tau_Aon = 490;   % adaptation time constant for ON (in samples at 50Hz)
 tau_Aoff = 504; % adaptation time constant for OFF (in samples at 50Hz)
 tau_ON = 36;   % time constant for ON filtering (in samples at 50 Hz, so ~ 1s)
 tau_OFF1 = 31;  % fast time constant for OFF differentiation (in samples at 50Hz)
 tau_OFF2 = 242; % slow time constant for OFF differentiation (in samples at 50Hz)
 
 scaleON = 1; % This parameter might be used to scale the ON response 
 scaleOFF = 1; % This parameter might be used to scale the OFF response 

 
 % NAVIGATION MODEL PARAMETERS
 turnbase = 0.12;  % baseline turn rate; this is a probability when used at 50Hz, we scale it when running at 15 Hz so the overall turn rate is the same
 tsigma = 20;     % sigma of turn amplitude distribution (degrees/s)
 vbase = 6;        % baseline velocity, mm/s

 tmodON =  0.03;    % strength of ON turning modulation 
 tmodOFF = 0.75;         % strength of OFF turning modulation 

 vmodON = 0.45;     % strength of ON velocity modulation (mm/s)
 vmodOFF = 0.8;    % strength of OFF velocity modulation (mm/s)

 kup = 5;          % strength of upwind drive (deg/samp)
 kdown = 0.5;       % strength of downwind drive (deg/samp)
